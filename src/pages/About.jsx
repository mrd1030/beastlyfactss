          <p className="font-body text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            BeastlyFacts is a fun, informative hub built for anyone who has ever fallen head-over-paws for an animal.
            Whether you're a reptile keeper who obsesses over thermostat gradients, a new dog owner Googling why your
            pup eats grass, or just someone who finds animal trivia endlessly fascinating — this is your place.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">
            The site is packed with hundreds of animal facts, in-depth care guides for reptiles and exotic pets,
            a growing encyclopedia of species profiles, a personality quiz that matches you to your spirit animal,
            and a regularly updated blog called the Critter Digest covering everything from UVB lighting to ball python
            feeding schedules. New content drops regularly, so there's always something fresh to discover.

            This site is for pet parents, families, kids, and curious minds of all ages. If you share your home with
            a bearded dragon, a ball python, a crested gecko, a cat, a dog, or a tank full of fish — there's
            something here for you. It's also great for people who don't (yet!) own pets but love learning cool,
            surprising facts about the animal kingdom.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">
            The care guides are written to be genuinely useful for beginners and intermediate keepers alike —
            no gatekeeping, no overwhelming jargon. Just clear, evidence-based information that helps animals
            thrive and their owners feel confident.

          <p className="font-body text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            BeastlyFacts is built and maintained by one person who genuinely loves learning about animals and
            sharing that knowledge with fellow enthusiasts. No big editorial team, no corporate backing — just a
            passionate individual who started keeping reptiles, fell deep into the rabbit hole of animal biology and
            behaviour, and decided to turn that obsession into something useful and fun for everyone.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">
            Every fact is researched, every care guide is written with real animals in mind, and the whole site
            is designed to feel like getting advice from a knowledgeable friend rather than reading a dry textbook.
