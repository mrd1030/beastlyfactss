# To do

The working list. Session task lists do not survive a cloud session, so this
file is the one that counts. Cross items off here, not in a chat window.

## 1. Write the federal law guide

**Done 2026-09-12.** `content/guides/federal-exotic-pet-laws-guide.mdx`, live,
hero installed, wired into RELATED_ARTICLES against 14 guide ids and linked
from the hub's federal section. Voice check clean, 0 errors and 0 warnings, all
14 sources return 200.

What it covers, all against primary text: the Lacey Act's two halves, the
injurious wildlife list and the 2017 D.C. Circuit ruling that ended the
interstate transport ban, CITES including the CoP20 amendments that took effect
5 March 2026 and the Chilean rose tarantula listing that takes effect 5 June
2027, the Captive Wildlife Safety Act and the Big Cat Public Safety Act, the FDA
four-inch turtle rule, and the Wild Bird Conservation Act.

The 52 state pages and the 52 animal pages both stop at the state line, and
every one of them has a reader who then asks "but is it legal federally."
Nothing on the site answers that.

What it has to cover:

- **Lacey Act** (16 U.S.C. § 3371 et seq.), including the injurious wildlife
  listings under 18 U.S.C. § 42 that actually bar interstate transport
- **CITES**, and the practical point that Appendix I vs II decides whether a
  captive-bred animal can cross a border at all
- **Captive Wildlife Safety Act**, which is the big-cat interstate rule
- **Big Cat Public Safety Act** (2022), the one most summaries still get wrong
  because it grandfathered existing owners
- **FDA four-inch turtle rule** (21 C.F.R. § 1240.62), still in force since
  1975 and the reason red-eared slider hatchlings are sold "for educational
  purposes"
- **Wild Bird Conservation Act**, which is why almost every parrot in the US
  trade is captive-bred

Research rule applies: real sources, quoted, no writing from memory. Wire it
into RELATED_ARTICLES and give it in-body internal links to the state hub and
to species pages the rule actually touches.

## 2. Finish converting the per-animal guide hubs

Partly done. Each species hub should carry the same block structure as the
converted ones. Work through the unconverted list rather than sampling.

## 3. Re-check the state law entries

Several cells rest on bills and petitions that were pending when they were
written and are dated July/August 2026 rather than confirmed:

- **PA HB 692** (sugar gliders): status as of the last check was pending, and
  the entry reads as if that is settled
- **CA ferret Petition 2025-003**: Fish and Game Commission docket, outcome not
  captured
- **SC 2025 venomous reptile bill**: same problem

Also worth a pass: the two internal contradictions already found and left in
because the statute itself contradicts itself (Nevada NAC 503.110 disagreeing
across its own two columns) should carry a note saying so rather than reading
as an error.

Re-verify, then bump `verifiedOn`. Do not bump a date without re-reading the
source.

## 4. Backlink outreach

Playbook and templates are in `docs/OUTREACH.md`. The short version:

- The site has 2 editorial referring domains against 21 from one PBN network.
  Twenty to forty genuine ones would move position.
- Lead with corrections, not requests. Four verified factual errors in
  circulation are listed in OUTREACH.md, and the Massachusetts ferret one is
  the best opener.
- State and regional herpetological societies are the highest-yield targets,
  and the pitch is the individual state page, not the homepage.
- Qwoted and Featured for journalist queries. Reply fast and in full.
- Wikipedia: Talk page only, with the connection disclosed. Never add the link.
- Reddit and Facebook groups: answer about ten questions for every one where
  you link, and write every answer so it stands alone without the link.

Keep a list of who was contacted, when, and whether it landed. Without one you
will re-contact people.

## 5. Wrong-species guide art

Skim run 2026-09-12 after the corn snake health hero turned out to be an
albino milk-snake-looking animal. 61 of the 183 heroes in
`public/assets/guides/` were opened and checked against the species, chosen
for look-alike risk rather than at random. The rest of that folder, and the
777 article heroes in `public/assets/images/`, are unchecked.

The pattern: the legal heroes are almost all right and the older care-guide
hub heroes are where the misses are. The legal set was generated against the
species-accuracy checklist in IMAGE_PROMPTS.md ("must be Chelydra serpentina,
not the alligator snapping turtle" and so on). The hub set never had one.
Several species now carry a correct legal hero and a wrong hub hero, which is
how most of these were caught.

Replace, most wrong first:

- **`hedgehog.jpg`** is a European hedgehog, dark spines and dark face. The pet
  is the African pygmy, cream spines with brown bands and a white face.
  `hedgehog-legal.jpg` has it right.
- **`hissing-cockroach.jpg`** has a black head and thorax, an orange abdomen
  and spiny legs. A hisser is uniformly glossy red-brown with the head tucked
  under the pronotum, which `hissing-cockroach-legal.jpg` shows correctly.
- **`california-kingsnake.jpg`** is a blotched desert snake with a red tongue,
  closest to a gopher snake. The species is black and white banded, as in
  `kingsnake-legal.jpg`.
- **`ball-python.jpg`** has a slender head and banded flanks in dry scrub,
  reading as an African rock python. `ball-python-legal.jpg` is the real thing.
- **`emperor-scorpion.jpg`** and **`emperor-scorpion-legal.jpg`** both show
  bright orange legs and an anatomically wrong second pair of claws. Emperors
  are uniformly glossy black with heavy granular pincers. Both need redoing.
- **`savannah-monitor-legal.jpg`** has the yellow ocelli and long snout of a
  Nile monitor, and sits next to `nile-monitor-legal.jpg`, which is the same
  animal done right. `savannah-monitor.jpg` has no dorsal ocelli at all.
- **`corydoras-catfish.jpg`** is a scaled minnow-shaped fish with barbels. A
  cory is armoured plated, stout and arch-backed with a downturned snout.

Lower confidence, worth a second opinion before spending art on them:

- `gerbil.jpg`: squirrel face, thin sparse tail, striped flank. A Mongolian
  gerbil's tail is furred with a dark tuft, as in `gerbil-legal.jpg`.
- `crested-gecko.jpg`: spines along the flanks a crestie does not have.
  Off-model against `crested-gecko-legal.jpg`.
- `boa-constrictor.jpg`: geometric netting and a head stripe that read
  reticulated python rather than boa saddles.
- `hognose-snake.jpg`: slender body and the upturned rostral scale, the one
  feature that identifies the species, not readable in the frame.
- `fire-bellied-toad.jpg`: the red and black belly pattern is painted on the
  flank and back. It belongs on the underside; the back is green and mottled.
- `ferret.jpg`: reads wild, in tall grass with a black-footed ferret's mask.
  Possibly fine for a sable domestic ferret, but it is not a pet photograph.

Checked and correct, for the record: all six dog and cat breeds sampled,
every parrot and finch, the turtles and tortoises, leopard gecko, gargoyle
gecko, African fat-tail, mourning gecko, fire skink, uromastyx, green anole,
tegu, ackie monitor, leaf-tailed gecko, milk snake, corn snake, garter snake,
rosy boa, burmese python, snapping turtle, tiger salamander, axolotl, betta,
pacman frog, White's tree frog, hermit crab, millipede, stick insect,
tarantula, degu, chinchilla, rat, mouse, hamster, sugar glider, flying
squirrel.

When these get redone, give the prompt file a species-accuracy block for the
hub set the way the legal set has one. Every miss above is a species the
generator confused with a close relative, which is exactly what that block
exists to prevent.
