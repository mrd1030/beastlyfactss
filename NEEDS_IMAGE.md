# Needs Image

The live queue for images that are blocked or drafted and not yet on disk. Open
items only. **Finished work does not stay here**: once a batch lands it is
recorded in `archive/docs-completed/NEEDS_IMAGE_COMPLETED_2026-09-17.md` and
removed from this file, which is the only place that history lives.

## Open right now

**Nothing.** As of 2026-09-17 every guide hero is on disk and every fact on the
site resolves its own photo, 328 of 328, none shared between two facts.

## Guide heroes still needed

None outstanding. The eight wrong-species replacements landed 2026-09-12
alongside the federal law guide hero, the fourteen legal-guide heroes on
2026-09-11, and the nine feeding-guide heroes on 2026-09-09.

## Facts awaiting images

None.

## How a blocked fact works

A fact can be drafted and parked here when no verified photo exists. Parked
facts are **not** added to `src/lib/data/facts.js`: a promoted fact whose image
never lands renders as dead text in a list where every neighbour opens a
picture. Promotion steps are in `BEASTLYPEDIA_FACT_GAPS.md`.

A full Wild Animals article can be parked the same way, saved as
`<slug>.mdx.draft` under `content/guides/`. The `.draft` suffix keeps
`check-images.mjs` and `sync-articles.js` from seeing it. Rename to `.mdx` once
the photo lands.

`BEASTLYPEDIA_FACT_GAPS.md` holds facts blocked on photos *and* tied to a
specific Beastfile page. Prompt style rules are in `IMAGE_PROMPTS.md`; the
prompts that produced existing images are in
`archive/docs-completed/IMAGE_PROMPTS_COMPLETED_2026-09-17.md`.
